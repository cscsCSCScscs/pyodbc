Not all ODBC drivers support *parameter arrays*, the internal ODBC mechanism that `fast_executemany` uses to do its magic. If you have additional or updated information on a particular driver please feel free to update this list.

| Database | Driver Name | Driver Version | OS | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Access | Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb) | Access_2010 | Windows | crashes CPython | |
| Microsoft SQL Server | ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server | 17.x | Linux/Windows | works | [local temporary tables](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks-by-Database-Platform#using-fast_executemany-with-a-temporary-table), [TVPs](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/601) |
| MySQL | MySQL ODBC 8.0 Unicode Driver | 8.0.12 | Windows | no effect | |
| Postgresql | PostgreSQL Unicode(x64) | 9.03.04 | Windows | no effect | |

"No effect" means that enabling `fast_executemany` does not seem to cause problems, but it also doesn't make any significant difference to the amount of network traffic generated by an `executemany` call.
